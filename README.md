Overview
This project involves loading, analyzing, and visualizing the Iris Dataset using Python libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn). The main tasks were:

Load and explore the dataset.

Perform basic data analysis (e.g., descriptive statistics, group analysis).

Create visualizations to highlight key insights.

Tasks Completed
1. Data Loading and Exploration
Loaded the Iris Dataset using sklearn and converted it into a pandas DataFrame.

Explored the dataset using methods like .head(), .info(), and .describe().

2. Basic Data Analysis
Computed basic statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for numerical columns.

Grouped the data by species and calculated the average of numerical columns for each group.

3. Data Visualizations
Created four visualizations:

Line Chart: Showed trends in sepal length.
    - Bar Chart: Compared average petal length across species.

     - Pie grapg: Displayed the distribution of sepal lengths.

    - Scatter Plot: Visualized the relationship between sepal length and petal length.

4. Error Handling
     - Implemented basic error handling to catch potential file or data issues.

Files
HIVdataset.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with the full analysis and visualizations.
HIVdataset.py: Python script version of the notebook.
hiv_prevalence.csv: Dataset used alonside the programme

**How to Run**
   Install the required libraries:

        - pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
        - Open iris_analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or run iris_analysis.py in a 
          Python environment.

**Key Insights**
Visualizations revealed trends, distributions, and relationships between the measurements of the flowers.

**Conclusion**
This project demonstrates basic data analysis and visualization techniques using Python. It provides insights into the Iris dataset and offers a foundation for more advanced analysis.
